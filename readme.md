Small library to generate cards as if they were from Library of Ruina.

### Examples

### TODO Before publishing

- Add missing images
- Map all pages (So they can be generated easily/as defaults)
- Add CLI usage (Alongside using classes from the package)
- Refator + Clean up
- Error handling / Messages about the generation
- Version bump (1.0.0)

### TODO after the TODO

- Work on the right side of the page (Skill effects / damage)
- Lose less quality when rotating icons
